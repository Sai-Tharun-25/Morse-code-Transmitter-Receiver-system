# Morse-code-Transmitter-Receiver-system
The project is a simple Serial Transmitter - receiver unit of morse signals transmitted as light pulses of fixed on and off durations. 
Connect the Transmitter to an input device, here the laptop keyboard and mount the compiled Transmitter code. 
Send information as text via the serial monitor which is encoded by the transmitter encoding logic. 
This information propagates through a transparent medium and is sensed by the receiverâ€™s photoresistor and is decoded at the receiver side. 
Both light and audio feedback is produced with a LED and buzzer to visually recognize and hear respectively the actual morse pulses that were transmitted as light.
